The algorithm which uses structs is much slower than the one which uses classes
for string data.  (436030 usecs vs 980 usecs).
I think this is because structs are value types and every time that struct is 
passed to the function, a copy of it is stored, whereas classes are referece 
types, and the function receives a reference to that object, without creating a 
new one.
